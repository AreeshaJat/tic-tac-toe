# tic-tac-toe

## Project Description
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe application where the user is able to add player names and enter the name of Player One and Player Two.

## Features and Functionality
The Tic-Tac-Toe application features instructions on the left-hand side of the page detailing how to play the game. Once users have read the instructions, they can click on the "Add Player Names" button to enter the names of Player One and Player Two. After entering this information, they can choose to cancel or submit. Upon submission, the players' names appear under the Player Information section, along with their respective symbols, indicating which player they are. To begin the game, users can click on the "Start Game" button. They can then select a square on the board, and the Player Information section will update to indicate whose turn it is. When a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a blue message will appear, indicating that the game is over. Additionally, users will be prompted to press the "Start Game" button if they wish to play again.
